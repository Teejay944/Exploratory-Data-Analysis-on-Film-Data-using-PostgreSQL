Project_Name: **Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Film-Data-using-PostgreSQL**

This project focuses on conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of films using PostgreSQL. By leveraging SQL queries and data visualization techniques, we aim to explore the dataset, answer specific business questions, and showcase proficiency in utilizing PostgreSQL for data analysis

**Disclaimer**: Please note that the dataset used in this project is not real-life data but is for the purpose of learning and demonstrating data analysis techniques.

**Project Structure**:
Database Setup: Establish the PostgreSQL database and load the films dataset.
Data Exploration: Conduct exploratory data analysis using SQL queries to examine film attributes and metrics.
Answer Business Questions: Address specific business questions or hypotheses by analyzing the data and presenting conclusions.
Documentation: Document the analysis process, findings, and insights in a Jupyter Notebook for easy sharing and reference.

**Project Tasks:**
Task 1: Data Retrieval
1. Connect to the "film" database using PostgreSQL and PgAdmin.
Task 2: Film Analysis
2. What are the top 10 highest-grossing films in the database, and when were they released?
3. How many films in the database were released in each country, and what are the top five 
countries?
4. How many films are available in each language, and what are the top three languages 
represented?
5. What is the average IMDb score for films in the database?
6. Which country has made the highest profit from movies?
7. Which movie made the highest profit in the 21st century?
8. How many people in the database are still alive (based on birthdate and death date)?
9. Which year has the highest number of movie releases?
Task 3: People and Roles Analysis
10. Determine the top 10 people with the most roles in the database.
11. Who are the top 10 actors or directors with the most roles in the database?
12. Identify how many people in the database are still alive.
Task 4: User Reviews and Votes Analysis
13. Calculate the average number of user and critic reviews for films.
14. Identify films with the highest number of user and critic reviews.
15. Which films have the most Facebook likes, and is there a correlation with their IMDb scores?
Task 5: Presentation and Report
16. Create a report or presentation summarizing their findings. If you want to create slides, you can 
use either PowerPoint or Google Slides. If you want to create a report, it should be in PDF 
format.
17. The report should contain a screenshot of the SQL code and another screenshot of the result. 
Then you explain your findings briefly.
